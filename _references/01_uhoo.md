  <p>I worked with Daniel on two occasions. First was designing the first prototype of an air sensor. Second was during a 24-hour hackathon in building the first prototype of what uHoo is today.</p>

  <p>His academic background is Mechanical Engineering, but during the hackathon he quickly activated his full engineering skillset and was able to integrate electronic components and write firmware that made the entire prototype work flawlessly during the presentation to the judges. He covered every aspect needed to be an excellent hardware engineer.</p>

  <p>Besides his technical know-how, he has good communication skills. He can elaborate and explain technical concepts in a way that is easy for non-technical people to understand. Having lived overseas, he is culturally sensitive and a fun person to have conversations with. He's an asset to have on your team.</p>

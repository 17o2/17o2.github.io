  <p>Daniel was my partner at the HKUST robotics lab. He is a talented engineer and very helpful as a team member. He is able to quickly validate an idea and learn any necessary skill to execute it. He has a wide and solid skillset and broad vision. He has worked with leading edge scientists in robotics and with his contribution, our team published a paper in ICRA 2015.</p>

  <p>Daniel is a good time manager: After a detailed and thorough planning, he delivers results in time and does not rush at the expense of quality. He always keeps a positive mood; therefore, working with him is quite an amazing experience. Besides his work in my lab, he engaged with the local community of Makers, exchanging ideas and offering help within his skillset.</p>

  <p>I am sure that Daniel is a perfect candidate for a project that requires careful design and quick prototyping. His strong hands-on skills, theoretical background and analytical thinking will ensure a successful outcome.</p>

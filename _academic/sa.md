  <p>In order to study a new concept for the design of an automatic storage and retrieval machine (AS/RS) for use in high-rise warehouses, a scale model of such an AS/RS is to be developed and built. In addition to the linear degrees of freedom in the x and y directions, the mast of the machine is to be equipped with a rotational DOF around the z axis. This would allow the device to operate similarly to an inverted pendulum, with a state controller keeping the balance.</p>

  <p>After creating a mathematical model of the system, its properties are to be chosen such as to mimic the oscillation properties of a real machine. To achieve the correct dynamics, appropriate drive motors have to be chosen and a feedback system has to be selected.</p>

  <p>Based on these calculations, a full CAD model is to be created using the ProEngineer software, and then machined using shop drawings derived from this model. The device must provide the option to control it using a fixed mast setup, as well as the inverted pendulum mode. Additionally, the possibility of simulating the oscillation properties of a real AS/RS should be provided using a system of springs and dampers. The means to actively tilt the mast using a dedicated actuator are also to be provided. In case of failure (such as a power outage or an error in the control software), a set of safety measures are to bring the system back into a stable state.</p>

  <p>This paper should serve as a base to determine whether a system with all the aforementioned capabilities is feasible, and whether such a system could have potential advantages versus traditional devices, especially with regard to access times, and whether this system could eventually be deployed in an industrial setting.</p>

summary: "Development of a jumping robot using soft pneumatic actuators"
abstract: >
  Soft robotics is an emerging field of novel mechanical designs that create compliant and tolerant structures out of flexible materials, attempting to reduce the complexity of both their hardware and software to compensate for or eliminate some of the constraints set by traditional ’hard’ robots such as low adaptability or high complexity. At the same time, jumping is a very interesting method of locomotion, with the animal kingdom providing myriads of very diverse and successful examples. The study of jumping or hopping robots could prove extremely useful in situations such as rough terrain, high obstacles and other complex environments.

  The goal of this project is to develop a mobile robot platform capable of jumping locomotion using soft, silcone elastomer based pneumatic actuators as legs that accelerate the platform upwards by expanding rapidly upon applying internal air pressure. The robot is able to control the direction of the jump by altering the timing patterns in which the individual legs are activated. It is equipped with on-board electronics that allow controlling and logging the jumping performance.

  After providing an overview on the existing research on jumping robots, fluidic actuation and soft robotics, the actuators themselves are designed, tested and their static and dynamic behavior characterized. Then, the robot platform is developed, including the structural design, the pneumatic system, the electronics and the control software. A protocol is implemented to allow wireless communication between the robot and a PC. A tetherless version with on-board electrical and pneumatic supply is also presented. Afterwards, several experiments are conducted to evaluate and improve the jumping performance with regards to height, distance and direction, and the insights gained are compiled to gauge the usefulness of such robotic systems. Furthermore, challenges encountered and pointers for further research are outlined.
